Terry Tao announced...
Easy proof
Easy counterexample
Another nonimplication (associativity does not imply commutativity)
Why equations?
Why magmas?
Scope of the project (22 million questions)
Lean and manual vs automated contributions
Transitivity (mention that the two algorithms are currently a part of the trusted codebase)
Dashboard
Equation explorer
Free magmas [for equation]
Difficult proof
Metatheorems (if an infinite counterexample exists, countable counterexample exists; abstract greedy algorithm)
Difficult counterexample
Finite magmas
